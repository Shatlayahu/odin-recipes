            This banana bread by Chef John is spiked with dark chocolate chips and walnuts. 
            Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose — only when 
            those last 3 bananas are almost black. However, this scrumptious loaf is so good 
            you'll want to make it well before the bananas reach that condition.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>⅓ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 165 degrees. Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. <br>
                Add mashed bananas and mix until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. <br>
                Stir in milk and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour mixture, walnuts, and chocolate chips until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. <br>
                Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. <br>
                Let rest in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bread from the pan, then slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
